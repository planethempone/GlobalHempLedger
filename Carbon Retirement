To finalize the Global Hemp Ledger (GHL), we must define the most critical transition in the lifecycle of a digital asset: Carbon Retirement.

In traditional markets, "retirement" is often a manual entry in a private database. In the Planet Hemp ecosystem, retirement is a cryptographic "burn" that permanently removes a 1$CO2e$ token from circulation, locking its ecological value to a specific industrial event or corporate offset.2







## 1. Technical Specification: The retire Function

The retirement function is a specialized version of a standard "burn." It doesn't just destroy a token; it transforms it into a Certificate of Sequestration.

Function Logic (Solidity):
Solidity


/**
 * @dev Retires carbon tokens to offset emissions.
 * @param amount Number of $CO2e$ tokens to retire (1 token = 1 metric ton).
 * @param beneficiary The entity receiving the offset credit.
 * @param reason Purpose of retirement (e.g., "Naval Hull Production #42").
 */
function retireCarbon(uint256 amount, string memory beneficiary, string memory reason) public nonReentrant {
    require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "GHL: Insufficient $CO2e$ balance");

    // 1. Move tokens to the Burn Address (0x000...dead)
    _burn(msg.sender, amount);

    // 2. Emit the Retirement Event for the Nexus and Indexers
    emit CarbonRetired(
        msg.sender, 
        beneficiary, 
        amount, 
        block.timestamp, 
        reason
    );
    
    // 3. Update the Global Resilience Metrics
    ResilienceLibrary.updateGlobalSequestration(amount);
}



## 2. Data Structure: The Retirement Event

The Nexus monitors the Ledger for these events to update the Equity Index 2.0. The event log must contain specific indexed parameters for fast querying:

Parameter	Type	Description
retirer	address (indexed)	The Sovereign or Entity burning the tokens.
beneficiary	string	The legal entity or project claiming the offset.
amount	uint256	Tons of $CO_2$ permanently removed.
timestamp	uint256	Block time of the retirement.
evidenceCID	string	IPFS link to the Eco-Guardian data proving the original sequestration.



## 3. The "Certificate of Sequestration" (Metadata)

Once the burn is confirmed, the GHL generates a Dynamic NFT (dNFT) or a signed metadata receipt. This is the "Product" the industrial partner holds.

Immutability: Once burned, the 3$CO2e$ cannot be re-minted or transferred.4







Traceability: The certificate is cryptographically linked back to the specific field and harvest year where the hemp was grown.

Double-Counting Protection: The smart contract logic ensures that a token ID can only be retired once.



## 4. Homeostatic Trigger: The "Supply Rebalance"

When a significant volume of $CO2e$ is retired, the TDCC logic triggers a Homeostatic Rebalance:

Scarcity Increase: The total circulating supply of $CO2e$ drops, increasing the value of remaining credits.

Incentive Boost: The $HEMP$ minting rewards for Cultivators may increase to encourage more planting to "refill" the sequestration pool.



## 5. Security Guardrails

The "Cooling Period": Credits cannot be retired within 48 hours of being minted to allow for Sovereign Audits of the sensor data.

Multi-Sig Requirement: High-volume retirements (e.g., >1,000 tons) require a secondary signature from a Level 5 Sovereign to verify the "Reason" field against actual industrial output.
