Tokenomics Whitepaper: The Hemp Ledger & Data-Farm Nexus.

Protocol Version: 1.0 (The Green Renaissance Standard)

Token Tickers: * $HEMP (Utility/Governance): The primary currency for the Global Hemp Ledger.

$CO2e (Settlement): A stable-credit pegged to 1 metric ton of sequestered carbon.

I. Executive Summary: The Circularity of Information The Global Hemp Ledger (GHL) reimagines the token economy as a biological-digital loop. Traditional data farms are linear: they consume energy and generate heat waste. Planet Hemp’s “Circular Data-Farm” model uses the heat output from server clusters to accelerate the drying of raw hemp biomass, while the hemp itself sequesters the carbon emitted by the local energy grid. The tokenomics model (HEMP) is the financial lubricant for this “Bio-Digital Synergy.”



II. Token Supply & Distribution (The Genesis Seed) We adopt a Fair Launch approach with a fixed maximum supply to prevent long-term debasement.

Total Fixed Supply: 500,000,000 $HEMP Initial Circulating Supply: 15% (75M $HEMP) Allocation Percentage Vesting Period Purpose Cultivator Rewards 40% 10 Years (Emission-based) Incentivizing biomass production. Resilience Fund 20% Permanent Treasury Buffer for market volatility/R&D. Ecosystem Development 15% 48 Months Linear Infrastructure (Galler/Italiëlei 26). Staking & Validation 15% Continuous Securing the Global Hemp Ledger. Founding Team/Sovereigns 10% 60 Months (12mo Cliff) Long-term alignment.



III. The Deflationary Burn Mechanism (The Harvest) Unlike speculative coins, HEMP uses Functional Deflation. The burn rate is tied directly to industrial activity and data-farm efficiency.

The Transaction Burn: 0.5% of every transaction on the GHL is permanently “retired” (burned) to a null address. The Carbon Retirement Burn: When an industrial partner “buys” carbon credits (CO2e) using HEMP, a portion of the HEMP used in that swap is burned to represent the permanent removal of carbon from the atmosphere. The Efficiency Bonus: Data-farms that achieve a PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) below 1.1 by integrating hemp-heat recycling systems trigger an “Automatic Supply Burn” from the treasury, increasing the scarcity (and thus value) for all holders.



IV. Circular Data-Farm Tokenomics Data farms are the “Nervous System” of the Nexus. We incentivize “Circular Siting”:

Incentive Nodes: Operators who colocate server racks with hemp-processing facilities receive a 30% boost in Staking Rewards. Heat-as-a-Service (HaaS): The GHL tracks the megajoules of waste heat transferred to hemp drying racks. This heat is tokenized as $THERM credits, which can be swapped for HEMP, effectively turning “waste” into “capital.”



V. The Equity Index 2.0 Staking Protocol To prevent “Whale Dominance,” voting power is not just a factor of token quantity, but “Imprint Quality.”

SovereignPower=(TokensStaked)×(VerifiedCarbonSequestration/1000)


This means a small farmer with high sequestration metrics can have equal governance weight to a large financial investor. This “Calibration Factor” ensures the platform remains a Meritocratic Democracy.

VI. The Resilience Fund Pivot In the event of a market crash, the Resilience Fund executes an “Automated Buy-Back.” It uses its reserves (backed by physical hemp-hulls and bio-resins) to purchase HEMP from the open market and lock it into the Cold Bridge Vaults, stabilizing the floor price during the “Winter” of a business cycle.

Vision: “The Proof of Planet” The HEMP token is more than a currency; it is a Proof of Planet (PoP) asset.

The HEMP token is more than a currency; it is a Proof of Planet (PoP) asset. Every token in circulation is mathematically tied to a physical hectare of soil being healed and a data-farm being cooled.
