## DETAILED METHODOLOGY (Excerpt)

### Carbon Quantification Formula (Farming)

```
CO₂ Sequestered = [(Biomass Yield × Carbon %) × 3.67] + Soil C - Emissions

Where:
- Biomass Yield: kg dry weight/hectare (measured at harvest)
- Carbon %: 45% (default) or lab-tested
- 3.67: Conversion factor (C → CO₂)
- Soil C: From sampling or IPCC Tier 2/3 models
- Emissions: Machinery, inputs (typical: 0.5-1.5 tonnes CO₂/ha)

Example:
6,000 kg/ha × 0.45 × 3.67 = 9,918 kg CO₂ (biomass)
+2,500 kg CO₂ (soil)
-1,000 kg CO₂ (cultivation)
= 11,418 kg = 11.4 tonnes CO₂/hectare
```

### Hempcrete Storage Formula

```
CO₂ Stored = (Volume × Hurd Density × C % × 3.67) + Binder Carbonation

Where:
- Volume: m³ of hempcrete
- Hurd Density: 100-150 kg/m³
- C %: 45% (hemp hurd)
- Binder Carbonation: 25-50 kg CO₂/m³ (research-based)

Example:
100 m³ × 120 kg/m³ × 0.45 × 3.67 = 19,818 kg
+3,500 kg (binder)
= 23,318 kg = 23.3 tonnes CO₂ (100-year storage)
```

### Biochar Removal Formula

```
CO₂ Removed = Biomass × Yield % × C % × Recalcitrance × 3.67

Where:
- Biomass: tonnes hemp feedstock
- Yield %: 30-40% (pyrolysis conversion)
- C %: 70-80% (biochar carbon content)
- Recalcitrance: 80-90% (stability after 100 years)

Example:
10 tonnes × 0.35 × 0.75 × 0.85 × 3.67
= 8.17 tonnes CO₂ (permanent removal)
```

2. **Verification Layer:** IoT sensors, audits
3. **Calculation Layer:** Smart contracts compute CO₂
4. **Credit Layer:** Tokenized carbon credits
5. **Marketplace Layer:** Buyers/sellers trade

### Smart Contract Pseudocode:
```
IF verified_biomass > threshold
AND soil_carbon_increase > 0
AND third_party_audit = PASS
THEN issue_carbon_credit(tonnes_CO2)
TRANSFER credit_to(farmer_wallet)
LOG transaction(blockchain_ledger)
```

### Technology Stack:
- Blockchain: Ethereum/Polygon
