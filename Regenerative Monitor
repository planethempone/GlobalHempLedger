Integrating real-time satellite data transforms the dashboard from a static report into a living Regenerative Monitor. We use the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral bands—specifically B4 (Red) and B8 (Near-Infrared)—to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

NDVI is a proxy for chlorophyll health; healthy plants reflect more NIR and absorb more Red light.

1. The Spectral Logic: Chlorophyll Health Index

We calculate the "Health Pulse" of a zone using the standard NDVI formula:




$$NDVI = \frac{B8 (NIR) - B4 (Red)}{B8 (NIR) + B4 (Red)}$$

0.8 - 1.0: Dense, healthy hemp canopy (High Chlorophyll).

0.3 - 0.7: Moderate growth or maturation phase.

< 0.2: Stressed vegetation, soil, or water.

2. Python Implementation: Sentinel-2 Overlay

To avoid heavy local processing, we use the Sentinel Hub API (or the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem) to request a processed NDVI tile for our specific coordinates.

Python



import streamlit as st
import folium
from streamlit_folium import st_folium

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
# In production, use your Sentinel Hub Instance ID
SENTINEL_HUB_WMS_URL = "https://services.sentinel-hub.com/ogc/wms/YOUR_INSTANCE_ID"

def add_satellite_overlay(m, lat, lon):
    """Adds a real-time NDVI tile layer from Sentinel-2."""
    # Define the NDVI layer from Sentinel Hub OGC services
    folium.WmsTileLayer(
        url=SENTINEL_HUB_WMS_URL,
        layers="NDVI",  # Predetermined layer in Sentinel Hub
        name="Chlorophyll Health (NDVI)",
        attr="Sentinel Hub / Copernicus",
        fmt="image/png",
        transparent=True,
        overlay=True,
        control=True
    ).add_to(m)

# --- DASHBOARD MAP SECTION ---
st.subheader("🛰️ Real-Time Chlorophyll Analysis")
st.info("Overlaying Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral data to verify hemp health.")

# Create the map (centered on a known hemp hub like Antwerp)
m = folium.Map(location=[51.24, 4.42], zoom_start=13, tiles="CartoDB positron")

# Add the live satellite layer
add_satellite_overlay(m, 51.24, 4.42)

# Render
st_folium(m, width=1100, height=500)

3. The "Biological Audit" Workflow

By integrating this data, the Global Hemp Ledger achieves Multi-Factor Verification:

Ground Truth: Eco-Guardian sensors report soil moisture and local $CO_2$.

Sky Truth: Sentinel-2 verifies the actual greening of the field (chlorophyll health).

The Imprint: The Nexus correlates these two data points. If they match, the $CO2e$ tokens are automatically "Validated" on the Ledger.

4. Advanced Insight: The Red-Edge Advantage

For even higher precision, we can leverage Sentinel-2's unique Red-Edge bands (B5, B6, B7). These are specifically sensitive to chlorophyll concentration and allow us to detect plant stress 48-72 hours before it's visible to the human eye.
