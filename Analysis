## 1. INTRODUCTION & METHODOLOGY

### 1.1 What is the Global Hemp Ledger?

The Global Hemp Ledger is a conceptual framework and practical system for tracking, verifying, and monetizing carbon sequestration and storage across hemp's complete lifecycle—from seed to final product and beyond. Unlike traditional carbon credit systems that focus solely on tree planting or renewable energy, the Hemp Ledger recognizes that hemp creates **multiple, cumulative layers of carbon value**:

- **Layer 1:** Atmospheric CO₂ captured during growth (photosynthesis)
- **Layer 2:** Carbon permanently stored in products (hempcrete, composites)
- **Layer 3:** Carbon savings from displacement (replacing concrete, plastic, fuel)
- **Layer 4:** Long-term sequestration in built environment (buildings standing for decades)

### 1.2 Research Methodology

This analysis synthesizes:
- **30+ peer-reviewed studies** on hemp carbon sequestration (2020-2025)
- **Market data** from leading carbon credit platforms (ICVCM, Verra, Gold Standard)
- **Industry reports** from hemp producers, construction firms, bioplastic manufacturers
- **Carbon market pricing** from voluntary and compliance markets (EU ETS, VCM)
- **Lifecycle assessments (LCA)** of hemp products vs. conventional alternatives

### 1.3 Scope & Limitations

**Included:**
- Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L. with <0.3% THC)
- Carbon sequestration and storage quantification
- Product-stage carbon values (cultivation → end-of-life)
- Current and projected carbon credit markets

**Excluded:**

## 2. STAGE 1: HEMP CULTIVATION & FARMING

### 2.1 Carbon Sequestration During Growth

**Research Findings:**

Industrial hemp is one of nature's most efficient carbon sequestration machines:

| Metric | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Average |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| **CO₂ absorbed per hectare/year** | 8 tonnes | 22 tonnes | 15 tonnes |
| **Carbon (C) stored per hectare** | 2.18 tonnes | 6.0 tonnes | 4.1 tonnes |
| **Growth cycle** | 90 days | 120 days | 100 days |
| **Crops per year (possible)** | 1 | 2 | 1-2 |

**Comparison to Other Carbon Sinks:**
- **Forests:** 2-6 tonnes CO₂/hectare/year
- **Cereals (wheat, barley):** ~1 tonne CO₂/hectare/year
- **Hemp advantage:** **2-4x more effective than forests**

**Key Research Citations:**
- Cambridge University (Darshil Shah, 2021): 8-15 tonnes CO₂/hectare
- Australian Government Hemp Report: 22 tonnes CO₂/hectare (with 2 crops/year)
- Russian Federation Study (2024): 14.78 tonnes CO₂/hectare deposited, 91% permanently stored

### 2.2 Carbon Distribution in Hemp Plant

**Biomass Breakdown:**
- **Hemp fibers (bast):** 45% carbon content by dry weight
- **Hemp hurds (shiv/woody core):** 45% carbon content
- **Hemp seeds:** 25-30% oil (biofuel potential)
- **Leaves & flowers:** Carbon returned to soil or processed

**Carbon Retention:**
- **Long-term storage:** 91% of carbon sequestered (in fibers/hurds used for products)
- **Short-term cycle:** 9% (seeds for food/oil, returned to environment quickly)

### 2.3 Soil Carbon Sequestration

**Additional Benefit:**
Hemp improves soil carbon through:
- **Root systems:** Deep taproots (2-3 meters) deposit carbon deep in soil
- **Biomass return:** Leaves and stalks left as mulch add organic matter
- **Soil microbiology:** Hemp feeds beneficial microbes, increasing soil carbon
- **Estimated soil carbon addition:** 2-3 tonnes C/hectare/year

**Total Carbon Impact (per hectare):**
- Atmospheric sequestration: 4.1 tonnes C/year (15 tonnes CO₂)
- Soil sequestration: 2.5 tonnes C/year
- **Combined: 6.6 tonnes C/year (24.2 tonnes CO₂ equivalent)**

### 2.4 Cultivation Emissions Offset

**Carbon Costs of Growing Hemp:**
- Tractor/machinery fuel: 0.2-0.5 tonnes CO₂/hectare
- Fertilizer (minimal, hemp requires little): 0.3-0.5 tonnes CO₂/hectare
- Processing (initial decortication): 0.1-0.2 tonnes CO₂/hectare
- **Total emissions:** 0.6-1.2 tonnes CO₂/hectare

**Net Carbon Balance (Cultivation):**
- Gross sequestration: 15 tonnes CO₂/hectare
- Cultivation emissions: -1.0 tonnes CO₂/hectare
- **Net positive: 14 tonnes CO₂/hectare**

**Conclusion:** Hemp farming is **carbon-negative**, removing 14x more CO₂ than emitted in production.

### 2.5 Carbon Credit Potential (Farming Stage)

## 3. STAGE 2: HEMPCRETE & CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS

### 3.1 Carbon Storage in Hempcrete

**What is Hempcrete?**
Hempcrete is a biocomposite made of:
- **Hemp hurds (shiv):** 70-80% by volume (woody core of hemp stalk)
- **Lime binder:** 20-30% (typically hydrated lime + natural hydraulic lime)
- **Water:** Added during mixing

**Dual Carbon Sequestration Mechanism:**

**A) Biogenic Carbon Storage (from hemp growth)**
- Hemp hurds contain 45% carbon by weight
- 1 m³ of hempcrete contains ~110 kg hemp hurds
- Carbon stored: **49.5 kg C per m³** (181.5 kg CO₂)

**B) Binder Carbonation (lime absorbing CO₂)**
- Lime binders react with atmospheric CO₂ over time (carbonation)
- Process continues for 50-100+ years
- Additional CO₂ absorbed: **18.5-38.4%** of binder production emissions recovered
- Net absorption: **15-35 kg CO₂ per m³** (over building lifetime)

**Total Carbon Storage in Hempcrete:**
- Biogenic storage: 181.5 kg CO₂/m³
- Binder carbonation: +25 kg CO₂/m³ (average)
- **Total: ~207 kg CO₂/m³ sequestered**

### 3.2 Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Comparison

**Hempcrete vs. Traditional Materials (1 m² wall, 260mm thick, U-value 0.27):**

| Material | Energy (MJ) | CO₂ Emitted (kg) | CO₂ Stored (kg) | Net CO₂ (kg) |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Hempcrete** | 394 | +50 | -85 | **-35** (negative) |
| **Concrete** | 560 | +52 | 0 | **+52** (positive) |
| **Fiberglass Insulation** | 480 | +47 | 0 | **+47** (positive) |

**Key Finding:** 
- Hempcrete wall: **Net -35 kg CO₂** (carbon sink)
- Concrete wall: **Net +52 kg CO₂** (carbon source)
- **Difference: 87 kg CO₂ per m²** (hempcrete advantage)

### 3.3 Long-Term Carbon Sequestration

**Permanence Factor:**
- Hemp fibers in hempcrete: Stable for 100+ years
- Lime binder carbonation: Continues throughout building life (50-100 years)
- **Carbon remains sequestered as long as building stands**

**Example Building (100m² house):**
- Wall area: 250 m² (interior + exterior)
- Hempcrete thickness: 300mm average
- Volume of hempcrete: 75 m³
- **Total CO₂ sequestered: 15,525 kg (15.5 tonnes)**
- **Carbon credits: 15.5 tonnes CO₂ = $93-775** (at $6-50/tonne)

**Scaling to Construction Sector:**
- If 10% of new construction (globally) used hempcrete
- Annual new construction: ~200 million m² (estimate)
- Hempcrete potential: 20 million m²
- **CO₂ sequestered: 1.7 million tonnes/year**
- **Carbon credit value: $10.2M - $85M/year**

### 3.4 Carbon Credit Methodology for Buildings

**Challenges:**
- Building-as-carbon-sink concept is emerging (not yet standardized)
- Permanence verification (buildings may be demolished)
- Monitoring over decades

**Proposed Solutions:**
1. **Certification at construction:** Verified carbon storage calculation
2. **Insurance/guarantee:** Builder commits to 50-year minimum lifespan
3. **Decommissioning protocol:** If demolished early, hemp recycled (maintains carbon storage)
4. **Registry:** Buildings tracked in centralized database

**Current Market:**
- Limited carbon credit issuance for buildings (as of 2025)
- Growing interest in "embodied carbon" credits
- Likely standardization by 2027-2030

**Alternative Monetization:**
- Green building certifications (LEED, BREEAM): Premium pricing for sustainable construction
- Carbon offset bundling: Developers offset other emissions with hempcrete
- Voluntary corporate purchases: Companies buy hempcrete carbon storage credits

### 3.5 Economic Value of Hempcrete (Beyond Carbon)

**Cost Comparison (per m³, installed):**
- Hempcrete: $300-500
- Traditional insulation + framing: $200-350
- Concrete: $150-250

**Value Proposition:**
- Higher upfront cost but:
  * Superior insulation (R-value 2.5 per inch)
  * Humidity regulation (breathable)
  * Fire resistance (Class 1)
  * Pest/mold resistance
  * Carbon sequestration value

**Carbon Value Addition:**
- Carbon credits: +$3-10/m³ (at current prices)
- Not sufficient to offset cost difference yet
- **But:** As carbon prices rise to $50-100/tonne (projected 2030-2035), hempcrete becomes cost-competitive

4. **Total: 0.8-1.5 tonnes CO₂ per tonne bioplastic produced**

**Comparison to Petroleum Plastics:**
- Traditional plastic (polyethylene): **+3.5-4.0 tonnes CO₂/tonne**
- Hemp bioplastic: **+0.8-1.5 tonnes CO₂/tonne**
- **Savings: 2.0-3.2 tonnes CO₂ per tonne** (57-80% reduction)

**Including Biogenic Carbon:**
- Hemp grows and sequesters carbon first
- If bioplastic biodegrades: Carbon returns to atmosphere (net neutral)
- If bioplastic is incinerated for energy: Carbon released but displaces fossil fuel
- **Lifecycle: Net negative to neutral** (depending on end-of-life)

### 4.2 Market Size & Applications

**End-of-Life Carbon Cycle:**
1. Hemp bioplastic biodegrades → CO₂ released
2. CO₂ absorbed by new hemp crop
3. New bioplastic made
4. **Closed carbon loop** (carbon-neutral over time)

**Circular Economy Model:**
- Hemp farm → bioplastic production → product use → composting → soil amendment → hemp farm
- Zero waste, carbon neutral/negative system
- **Stark contrast** to petroleum plastic linear model (extract → use → landfill)

### 4.5 Economic Projections

**Current Challenges:**
- Hemp bioplastics cost 2-3x more than petroleum plastics
- Limited processing infrastructure
- Consumer awareness/acceptance

**Price Trajectory:**

- 2025: $1,200-1,500/tonne (petroleum plastic)
- **Gap: $1,000-2,000/tonne**

**With carbon pricing:**
- If carbon credits valued at $50/tonne CO₂
- Hemp bioplastic carbon value: +$775/tonne
- **Adjusted cost gap: $225-1,225/tonne**

**By 2035 (projected):**

## 7. GLOBAL HEMP LEDGER FRAMEWORK

### 7.1 Conceptual Architecture

The Global Hemp Ledger is a **digital tracking and verification system** that follows carbon through hemp's entire lifecycle:

**Layer 1: Cultivation Registry**
- GPS coordinates of hemp farms
- Hectares planted, variety, planting/harvest dates
- Verified carbon sequestration (based on dry weight biomass yield)
- Soil carbon measurements (optional but valuable)
- **Output:** Carbon sequestration certificates (tonnes CO₂)

**Layer 2: Processing & Product Allocation**
- Track hemp biomass to processing facilities
- Categorize outputs: fiber → textiles, hurds → hempcrete, seeds → oil/food
- Allocate carbon credits to product streams proportionally
- **Example:** 1 tonne hemp biomass → 25% fiber, 50% hurd, 25% seed
  - Hempcrete (hurds): Receives 50% of carbon credits

**Layer 3: Product Carbon Storage Tracking**
- Hempcrete buildings: Registry of structures, carbon embedded, expected lifespan
- Bioplastics: Track usage, estimate degradation timeline
- Biochar: Soil application sites, permanence verification
- **Output:** Long-term carbon storage certificates

| Formulation | Hemp Hurd (kg) | Carbon Stored (kg C) | CO₂ Equiv (kg) |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Low-density (240 kg/m³) | 90 | 40.5 | 148.5 |
| Medium-density (300 kg/m³) | 110 | 49.5 | 181.5 |
| High-density (400 kg/m³) | 150 | 67.5 | 247.5 |

### Appendix B: Carbon Credit Calculation Methodology

**Step 1: Measure Biomass**
- Dry weight of hemp at harvest (tonnes/hectare)
- Example: 7 tonnes dry biomass/hectare

**Step 2: Calculate Carbon Content**
- Carbon = Biomass × 0.45 (45% carbon in hemp)
- Example: 7 t × 0.45 = 3.15 tonnes C

**Step 3: Convert to CO₂ Equivalent**
- CO₂ = Carbon × 3.67 (molecular weight ratio)
- Example: 3.15 t C × 3.67 = 11.56 tonnes CO₂

**Step 4: Subtract Cultivation Emissions**
- Net CO₂ = Gross - Emissions
- Example: 11.56 t - 1.0 t = 10.56 tonnes CO₂

**Step 5: Apply Permanence Factor**
- Credits = Net CO₂ × Permanence %
- Example: 10.56 t × 0.91 = 9.61 tonnes CO₂ (credits issued)

### Appendix C: Market Comparisons

**Hemp vs. Other Agricultural Carbon Projects:**
| Project Type | CO₂/ha/year | Credit Price | Revenue/ha |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Hemp farming | 10-14 t | $20-50 | $200-700 |
| Agroforestry | 4-8 t | $25-60 | $100-480 |
| Soil carbon (no-till) | 2-4 t | $30-70 | $60-280 |
| Cover cropping | 1-3 t | $20-50 | $20-150 |

**Hemp advantage:** 2-5x more revenue potential per hectare
