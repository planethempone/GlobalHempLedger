1. App Overview

Purpose

The GHL Farmer App enables hemp farmers to:
- Enroll their plots in the carbon credit program
- Monitor carbon capture progress in real-time
- Track earnings from verified carbon credits
- Manage sensors and receive alerts
- Get paid directly to their bank account

Key Principle: Hide the Crypto

The app abstracts all blockchain complexity. Farmers see:
- Euros, not tokens
- "Verified carbon" not "minted credits"
- "Earnings" not "wallet balance"
- "Bank transfer" not "fiat offramp"

The blockchain is infrastructure, invisible to the user.

Target Platforms

- iOS 14+ (iPhone 8 and newer)
- Android 10+ (API level 29)
- React Native for cross-platform development
- Offline-first architecture with background sync
